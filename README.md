## Data Storage
The data file that stores the entries is managed by Windows, so if you move or rename the executable the entry data is reset - unless you move the user config file to the same folder as the exe ([contact me for help](http://walkman100.github.io/contact)). They are also stored in a different folder for each version, which you will have to manually copy to keep the entry data.

## Compile requirements
